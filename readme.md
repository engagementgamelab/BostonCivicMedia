#Boston Civic Media Website

BostonCivic.Media is built on [Kirby](http://getkirby.com/), a flat-file (database-free) CMS. 

To run: 
- Open the command line in the BostonCivicMedia folder, and run "php -S localhost:8000" (make sure you have php installed)
- Navigate your browser to localhost:8000/conference
- That's it. 

To edit content (e.g. write posts, edit text, add new pages, add people), navigate your browser to localhost:8000/panel.

To turn your sassy, organized SCSS into plain old CSS every time you save the file, run "sass --watch [the scss file you want to watch]" from the assets/css folder.
